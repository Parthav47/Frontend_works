# Random Quote Generator (Frontend Only)

This is a **frontend-only** web application that dynamically displays inspirational quotes with stylish transitions and randomized background effects.

## 🌟 Features

- Randomly selects and displays quotes from a predefined list.
- Stylish glassmorphism UI with quote flip animation.
- Dynamically changing background and box color with each quote.
- Clean and responsive layout.

## 📁 Files Included

- `index.html` – Contains the main structure of the webpage.
- `style.css` – Provides the layout, colors, and animations.
- `script.js` – Controls quote logic, animations, and dynamic color transitions.
- `README.md` – This documentation file.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Keep all files (`index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`) in the same directory.
3. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
4. Click the **Flip Quote** button to see a new random quote and background.

## 🔧 How It Works

- Quotes are stored in a JavaScript array (`script.js`).
- On clicking the button, a new quote is selected at random.
- The background color of the body and quote box also changes randomly.
- A flip animation is applied to the quote box for visual effect.
